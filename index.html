  <!-- ================= WHAT IS GOON ================= -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="section-inner">
      <h2 class="fade">What is GOON?</h2>

      <p class="fade">
        GOON didn’t start with a grand plan.
        It began in the quiet space between uncertainty and curiosity —
        where nothing felt certain, but stopping felt worse than moving forward.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        The name GOON comes from the idea of <em>“go on”</em>.
        To continue when direction is blurred.
        In a space obsessed with destinations, targets, and moons,
        GOON chose motion over promises.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="quote fade">
        Not a promise of arrival —  
        just the decision to keep moving.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="fade">
        GOON is not built on guarantees.
        There is no roadmap carved in stone.
        No illusion of control.
        Only momentum, attention,
        and the shared instinct to see what happens next.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        This is an experiment —
        not just in technology,
        but in restraint.
        In choosing not to shout.
        In choosing not to explain everything.
      </p>

      <p class="fade">
        GOON exists for those who understand
        that not everything valuable announces itself.
        Some things don’t rush toward the spotlight.
        They simply continue —
        quietly, steadily —
        until they are noticed.
